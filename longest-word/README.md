# Longest Word in a Sentence

Write two functions. One, `findLongestWordLength()`, will return the length of the longest word in a sentence. The other, `findLongestWord()`, will return the longest word in a sentence or the first instance of a word with the maximum length. In both cases, assume that there is no punctuation in these sentences.

Challenges:
* write a function, `findLongestWords()` (notice the s!), that will return an array of all words in the sentence with the maximum length.
* allow users to input sentences with punctuation and make sure that punctuation is not interfering with your word lengths. Only count alphabetical characters.
* write a function, `orderByWordLength()`, that returns an array of all of the words in the sentence ordered by the length of the words, longest words first and shortest words last.
