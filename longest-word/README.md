# Longest Word in a Sentence

Write two algorithms. One, `findLongestWordLength()`, will return the length of the longest word in a sentence. The other, `findLongestWord()`, will return the longest word in a sentence or the first instance of a word with the maximum length.

Challenge: write an algorithm that will return an array of all of the instances of the word with the maximum length.
