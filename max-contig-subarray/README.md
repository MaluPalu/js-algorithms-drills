# Maximum Contiguous Subarray

**Problem:** Using the starter code, write a js function that finds the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return that sum.

Example: in the array `[-2,-3,4,1,-1,-5,4]` the maximum contiguous subarray would be `[4,1]` and the returned result would be 5 because 4+1 = 5.
