Write a function that takes in one input, a String, and return `true` if it is a palindrome and `false` if it is not. Make your solution case-insensitive.

A palindrome is a word that is the same forwards and backwards.

Examples:

Input: "racecar"
Output: true

Input: "Hannah"
Output: true

Input: "Blarg"
Output: false
